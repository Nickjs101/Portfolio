        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Project Description</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 ">My organization is working to make their system secure. My job is to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.</p>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). I need to investigate all failed login attempts after business hours.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 and on the day before needs to be investigated.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">After investigating the organization’s data on login attempts, it was determined that there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve Employees in Marketing</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">My team wants to update the computers of certain employees in the marketing department. To do this, I have to get the information on which employee machines need to get updated.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">The computers of employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security update is needed, I need to get information on employees only from these two departments.</p>
        <img src={SQL5} alt="Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales" className="w-full h-auto mb-6 rounded-lg"/>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Retrieve All Employees Not in IT</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology Department. To make this update, I need to get information on these employees.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Summary</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 ">I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables: log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.</p>
